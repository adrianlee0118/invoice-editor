## About

A simple invoice editor made with ReactJS, Redux and Webpack. Redux reducers were tested using Jest.

The app allows users to add line items and calculates the subtotal, tax and total from the quantities and prices of all items. The quantity and price properties of line items can be edited after they have been submitted.

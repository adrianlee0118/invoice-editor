Build an invoice editor that allows a user add, edit, or remove line items according to the text-based mockup below. 
Pricing should be updated on-the-fly as line items are added or edited. Don't worry about persisting invoices.

Item                      Qty     Price       Total
--------------------------------------------------------
Widget                   [ 2 ]  [ $10.00 ]  [ $20.00 ] x
Cog                      [ 2 ]  [ $15.99 ]  [ $31.98 ] x
[ New Item ]             [   ]  [        ]  [        ]

                                    --------------------
                                    Subtotal      $51.98
                                    Tax (5%)       $2.60
                                    Total         $54.58
                                    --------------------
